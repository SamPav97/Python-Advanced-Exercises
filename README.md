# Python-Advanced-Exercises
Some of the problems I solved in my Python Advanced course

In this course I learned to create, work with, and apply linear data structures, Stacks & Queues, Tuples & Sets, Matrices (Multidimensional Lists), as well as files and directories. I had the opportunity to take an in-depth look at recursive functions and functions with multiple arguments. Finally, I proceeded to solve algorithmic problems (problem solving skills) that significantly advanced my algorithmic thought. The course taught me to work with and orient with ease within the functional programming paradigm. 

After having completed a series of general introductory Python courses over the months of February, March, and April 2021, I started my official education with SoftUni by entering their ‘Programming Basics with Python’ course in the summer of the same year. I then continued onto their ‘Programming Fundamentals with Python’ course, which started in September and finished in December of 2021. 

I then completed their ‘Python Advanced’ course. The ‘Python Advanced’ course lasted a month with 3-hour-long classes four times a week and graded homework assignments. Every second class would be an “exercise class” with more sophisticated problems for homework, while every first class was a “lab class” where we got introduced to new concepts through easier problems. Some of the problems I solved you can find above.
