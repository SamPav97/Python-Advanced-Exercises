# Python-Advanced-Exercises
Some of the problems I solved in my Python Advanced course

In this course I learned to create, work with, and apply linear data structures, Stacks & Queues, Tuples & Sets, Matrices (Multidimensional Lists), as well as files and directories. I had the opportunity to take an in-depth look at recursive functions and functions with multiple arguments. Finally, I proceeded to solve algorithmic problems (problem solving skills) that significantly advanced my algorithmic thought. The course taught me to work with and orient with ease within the functional programming paradigm.
